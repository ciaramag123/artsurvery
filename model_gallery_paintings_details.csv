A Political Meeting (In the West of Ireland),Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=a-political-meeting-in-the-west-of-ireland-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1905.Dimensions: 71.5 × 53.25cm.Medium: Watercolour and pencil.Collection: Niland Collection.Provenance: Presented to Sligo County Library and Museum by James A.

Description:
On 11 February 1905 the Lily of Lough Gill branch of the Irish National Foresters welcomed the Lord Mayor of Dublin, secretary general of the society, to Sligo. The latter was the only surviving member of those who had founded the Irish National Foresters, a nationalist organisation which had broken away from the Ancient Order of Foresters in 1877. It was one of the most widespread and popular Irish friendly societies of the pre-World War One period with branches in several countries throughout the world.
Yeats’s painting shows members of the Foresters wearing sashes and carrying banners depicting Robert Emmet and Irish harps and jostling for position outside the town hall in Sligo. The Lord Mayor of Dublin can be seen in an upper floor window of this building, obviously speaking with great passion, his arms raised dramatically. His speech attacked the evils of emigration. Behind the swirling forms of the foresters and the grey buildings of the town can be seen the mountains of the Ben Bulben range and a dark stormy sky.
Yeats was in England at the time of this event and probably based his painting on a photograph [speaker-mute](1)[/speaker-mute]. His version manages to capture the dynamic movement of the crowd and resonates with the burgeoning nationalist fervour of this period. Yeats was probably drawn to the subject as it was reminiscent of his 1898 visit to Sligo when he witnessed the unveiling of a monument to Bartholomew Teeling, a hero of the 1798 rebellion which occasioned a similar sense of excitement and historical occasion. The work was acquired by John Quinn at an exhibition in Dublin in 1905 and transported to New York. James A. Healy subsequently bought it in 1939 and donated it to Sligo in 1965.

Description
Born into a landed family in County Roscommon, Percy French is best remembered as a poet, entertainer and song writer whose most popular composition was Where the Mountains of Mourne Sweep Down to the Sea.
In 1872 he entered Trinity College to read engineering, but his studies appear to have taken second place to his love of music and theatre and it took him eight years to graduate. Although he never studied art, French always painted and sketched in his spare time and his work was exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy on several occasions. His success as an entertainer resulted in a great deal of travel throughout Ireland, England and beyond. He painted many of the landscapes that he encountered, including scenes of New York, Quebec and Switzerland, but always returned to the boglands and rugged hills of the west of Ireland.
Like Jack B. Yeats, whose drawings on Sligo Quay are in the collection of the Model and Niland, French chose to depict an urban scene of Sligo rather than one of the more popular rural views of the area. Unlike Yeats, French seldom included figures in his compositions and as a result his work is more topographical than documentary.

A Western Town at Night,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=a-western-town-at-night-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1925Dimensions: 35.5 × 23cmMedium: Oil on panelCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Presented by James A. Healy in New York to Sligo County Library and Museum. In memory of his parents, John and Catherine Healy in 1966.
Description:
The Western Town referred to in the title is almost definitely Sligo. Yeats transforms this familiar place into a theatrical backdrop in which a near encounter between two figures is enacted. It is night but the light from an open doorway illuminates the scene. Two men walk in opposite directions. One is a portly businessman in bowler hat, while the other a worker, in his flat cap, is tall and lanky, and strides towards the light. The two figures are situated in an open space like a stage in a theatre. They impart a sense of ease and contentment as they go about their nocturnal routine. The dark towering forms of the buildings in the background and the dramatic red and blue of the sky add a note of tension to the scene suggesting the beauty and sublimity of the West.

An Island Funeral,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=an-island-funeral-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1923Dimensions: 91.5 × 61cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Purchased by public subscription from the Capuchin Annual in 1962
Description:
This sharply observed painting depicts a coffin being brought from the remote Blasket Islands, off the West Kerry coast, to the mainland for burial in the graveyard at Ventry. There was no graveyard on the islands. The coffin is accompanied by a subdued group of mourners, including women wearing traditional black shawls. They contrast with their younger female companions who are instead attired in fashionable modern dress. On the left hand side of the composition another boat can be seen coming alongside. Its crew, who look towards the funeral boat, add to the strong sense of community evoked by the painting. The work emphasises the importance of ritual and custom in the lives of remote communities in Ireland in a period of political turbulence. As in other works of this period Yeats sets traditional practices against the increasing modernity of Irish life. The image of the boat carrying a coffin across the water has a classical connotation in that it recalls the story of Charon ferrying the souls of the dead across the river Styx to Hades.

An Island Man,Jack B.

Healy as a memorial to his parents John and Catherine Healy.
Description:
This is the original drawing for the frontispiece of John Millington Synge’s The Aran Islands (1907), to which Yeats contributed 12 pen and ink illustrations. The original drawings were later hand-coloured in watercolour when Yeats exhibited them.
Yeats met Synge in 1905 when the two men were commissioned to produce a series of articles on the Congested Districts Board for the Manchester Guardian. They travelled together through Mayo and Galway in the summer of 1905, Synge gathering information for his articles while Yeats sketched potential images. The meeting with Synge had a profound impact on Yeats who was impressed by the writer’s knowledge and understanding of life in the West of Ireland, and also by his personality.
Synge spoke Irish and had spent several summers living on Inishmore, as recounted in his book. While most of Yeats’s illustrations to the Aran Islands show the islanders at work, the frontispiece shows an islander standing on the coastline looking out to sea. He wears traditional Aran Island costume as described by Synge. This includes his hat, his waistcoat or bainín jacket, his flannel trousers tied with a plated crios belt and his cow-skin pampooties. According to Synge’s account of the islanders, their clothes suited their life on the islands. The pampooties, for example, enabled them to clamber across its rocky terrain. Yeats’s frontispiece emulates Synge’s combination of ethnography with his keenly felt admiration for the islanders and their way of life. The man’s confident pose and distinctive appearance lend him an air of dignity. The difficulty of his existence is hinted at by the rocky outcrop in the background of the drawing.

Angels Ascending and Descending with Heavenly Spectators,Patrick Hall (b.1935),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=angels-ascending-and-descending-with-heavenly-spectators-by-patrick-hall-b-1935,"Date: 2002Medium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Purchased by The Model Arts and Niland Gallery, Sligo, from the Green on Red Gallery, Dublin, 2003
Description:
Patrick Hall, a well established artist who has lived in London, Spain and Dublin moved to Sligo in the mid 1990s. He has described this experience as ‘moving upwards and inwards, into hills and mountains’. The large scale and expansive space of these paintings seem at some level to reflect the spaciousness of the Western landscape and coastline. The subject matter of both paintings and of much of Hall’s other work of recent years is drawn largely from the Bible, a book which Hall considers to be rather like a great painting. He has always been interested in biblical stories as a source of happiness and as a description of a world where emotional life is complete (1).
The two Niland paintings refer to this idea in that they depict incidents from the scriptures where the earthly sphere is united with the eternal spiritual world. In Jesus Walking on the Sea, the tiny figure of Jesus stands on tumultuous waves with the boat and apostles at some distance. The pattern and dark grey colour of the waves dominates the painting. Angels Ascending and Descending with Heavenly Spectacular refers to the story of Jacob’s ladder, when Jacob rests for the night and dreams of a ladder reaching up to heaven with angels going up and down. Hall uses this tale as the basis for his extraordinary painting in which an earth red landscape with stone like forms is covered by lines of figures. The religious sources are used in a universal, metaphysical sense. Hall is not a religious artist. Rather he paints subjects drawn from religious texts in a childlike, uncomplicated way analogous to the way in which biblical stories are constructed and retold. But this simplicity belies the enormously profound ideas of mortality and immortality which both the Bible and Hall’s painting seek to convey. Hall’s approach calls into question the authority of religious beliefs and emphasizes the tenuousness of day to day existence by using simple forms to retell and re-imagine the familiar stories of the scriptures.

Description:
In 1903 Jack Yeats and wife, Cottie, were commissioned to design the sodality banners for new cathedral at Loughrea, Co. Galway. Designs for 29 banners were completed – one for each of the sodalities which met monthly in honour of the Sacred Heart. The banners were embroidered in wool and silk on linen at the Dun Emer industries by Lily Yeats and her assistants and now hang at Loughrea. The work was part of an ambitious programme for the design of the cathedral which was intended to present the best of modern Irish religious art and to evoke the spirit of Celtic craftsmanship and design. It was to provide a vital alternative to the mass-produced church monuments and furnishings which dominated Irish churches of the period.
In this banner, dedicated to the Sacred Heart, Christ stands with arms outstretched. The symbol of the Sacred Heart is emblazoned on his chest. The stigmata are evident on his feet and hands. In each corner of the design are symbols of the Passion – the chalice, the spear, the sponge and the whip. Yeats uses the device of entwined briars to frame the design, a reference to the Crown of Thorns. The simplicity of these symbols brings to mind late medieval Dominican and Franciscan iconography.

Communicating with Prisoners,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=communicating-with-prisoners-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: c. 1924Dimensions: 59 × 44cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Purchased by public subscription from the Capuchin Annual in 1962
Description:
This is one of Yeats’s most important depictions of life in Dublin in the early years of the Free State. A group of women call up to republican prisoners incarcerated in Kilmainham Jail. The latter, also women, have been interned by the Free State government for their involvement in the Civil War. They have broken the windows of the jail, through which one figure can be seen leaning out, to shout messages to their friends below. Yeats juxtaposes the sombre tower of the jail with a brightly coloured hoarding on which advertisements for bazaars and entertainments are pasted.
These contrasting forms convey the conflicting experiences of communication in Ireland in this period, one of censorship and control, the other of opportunity and apparent freedom of choice. The line of standing women makes a visual connection between the two horizontal elements of the tower and the hoarding. Their proximity to the posters and the variety of the women’s attire show that they are part of modern Ireland but their frustrated attempts to converse with the prisoners contradicts any notion of freedom. Hilary Pyle thinks that the work may have been painted from a photograph (1). It uses a stark composition in which the undulating outline of the women is mirrored by the blue silhouette of the houses in the distance behind them.

Country Scene,Maurice MacGonigal PRHA (1900 – 1979),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=country-scene-by-maurice-macgonigal-prha-1900-1979,"Date: N.D.Dimensions: 75.25 × 62 × 75.25cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Presented by James A Healy, 1975 (Josephine C Healy Memorial Collection)
Description:
The son of a painter and decorator from Sligo, Maurice MacGonigal was born in Dublin and gained his early art education through an apprenticeship in his uncle’s stained glass firm. This studio, owned by Joshua Clarke, was also the artistic nursery for MacGonigal’s cousin Harry Clarke, who became Ireland’s most celebrated stained glass artist.In 1917, MacGonigal’s political convictions led him to join Na Fianna Éireann, the nationalist youth organisation founded in 1909 by Constance Markievicz and Bulmer Hobson. Graduating to the Irish Republican Army, he took part in military activities that led to his arrest and imprisonment in Kilmainham Jail and Ballykinlar Camp, Co. Down.
After his release he attended evening classes at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and soon won a scholarship for full time study. Like his contemporary, Seán Keating, MacGonigal was to play an influential role in the shaping of twentieth-century Irish art. He was Professor of Painting at the National College of Art from 1954–1969 and took over the Presidency of the Royal Hibernian Academy when Keating resigned in 1962.Depicting an old man and his dog in an unspecified western landscape, Country Scene displays the influence of Paul Henry’s picturesque images of thatched cottages under benign cloud-filled skies.

Fortune and her wheel,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=fortune-and-her-wheel-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1902Dimensions: 43.5 × 28.5cmMedium: Pencil and poster paint on cardCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Presented by James A. Healy in 1965
Description:
A woman sits with a fortune wheel on a stone wall surrounded by a crowd of men. To her right a bearded man in theatrical costume holds out bags of money, displaying the prize on offer. A customer puts a coin in the woman’s hand, while another figure walks away clenching his fists to his face, having lost his money. A third man lies curled up asleep under the wall oblivious to the event. To the left a wheel-like semi-circle of men stand transfixed by the couple and their wheel.
The painting with its silver sky is a parody of the historical subject of Fortune and Her Wheel which uses an allegorical female figure and her spinning wheel to represent the capricious nature of fate. Yeats transfers the subject to an Irish fairground and enlivens it through the diverse characters he depicts. The work displays Yeats’s sense of humour and his insight into human nature as well as his willingness to subvert high art subject matter and present it in terms which are accessible and amusing.

G’Morrow Strawberry,Jack B.

Description:
The tiny dimensions of this work indicate that it was probably originally a page from one of the Yeats’s pocket-sized sketchbooks. Its humorous image shows a donkey ‘kissing’ a foal. Yeats his inscribed it ‘G’morrow Strawberry’, the typical sort of droll comment given by the artist to his sketches. Yeats presented the work to the poet and editor of the Dublin Magazine, Seamus O’Sullivan in 1945. He gave away a number of his early sketchbooks and drawings to friends and supporters at this time. He may have decided to give this particular painting to O’Sullivan as Yeats’s scrapbook of newspaper cuttings reveal that O’Sullivan had referred to it as ‘irresistible’ in a review in the United Irishman some forty years previously.

Description:
This late oil painting recalls the strand races that Jack Yeats attended in Sligo as a youth and which formed an important theme in his early watercolour paintings of Irish life. In this work, unlike many of the early renditions, Yeats does not refer to the characters and the wider paraphernalia of such events. While a group of bystanders is visible in the background to the left, the main focus of the painting is the race itself. The horses and riders gallop at great speed across the sands. One of the horses, a large black animal, moves across to the left, racing in a slightly different direction to the others. Perhaps it is this horse, or its jockey, to which the title of the painting refers.
The low viewpoint gives an unusual vista of the race, heightening the sense of movement and capturing the speed and drama of the occasion. The strong colours of the horses and jockeys are diffused by the strong white of the sky. The technique is as dynamic and vivacious as the subject it depicts.

Description:
Miller’s portraits of artists and writers, people with whom he has a creative affinity, are particularly powerful. This image of the author John McGahern (1934–2006), who lived near Miller, is one of the most successful literary portraits in recent Irish art.
Like Barrie Cooke, John McGahern, shared Miller’s devotion to life in the west of Ireland. While both painters are foreigners who chose to settle in rural Sligo, McGahern was born into a farming background in Leitrim and after years in Dublin and London, returned to the way of life that inspired much of his literature.
Miller recalls that, while sitting for this portrait, McGahern entertained him with stories about his years in London and the people he met there including Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. Astonishingly, McGahern never looked at the portrait in progress and probably never saw the finished piece. He was happy to sit for Miller but feared that he wouldn’t know what to make of a likeness of himself.
Despite such claims, the process of sitting for Miller may have influenced McGahern’s 2002 novel That They May Face The Rising Sun, which includes an artist character who has come to live in the west.

Johnny Patterson singing ‘Bridget Donoghue’ (The Singing Clown),Jack B.

Healy in New York to Sligo County Library and Museum. In memory of his parents, John and Catherine Healy in 1966.
Description:
The clown was a figure of unending fascination for Yeats who, like other modernist artists, saw parallels between his role as an artist and that of the clown within the circus. This painting depicts a specific historical figure, the legendary Johnny Patterson (1840-89). Yeats saw him perform in Sligo as a child and he appears in a number of his later oil paintings. An acrobat and circus performer, Patterson went to New York in 1879 where he met with great success. After his return to Ireland he set up his own circus company, Patterson’s Great United States Circus. His writing and performing of his own songs, such as Bridget Donoghue, earned him the title of the Singing Clown. Patterson died tragically as a result of injuries sustained by an attack in the circus ring when members of the crowd reacted violently to his rendition of a political song.
Patterson is shown singing to a crowd in a circus tent. Beside him stand enthusiastic members of the audience who have come down from their seats to join him in the ring. Patterson is set apart from them by his elevated position and by his clown’s make-up and elaborate costume which was embroidered with shamrocks and Celtic harps.

Description:
Jack Yeats gave this painting to his wife Cottie on her birthday in 1947. She died two months later. It shows Yeats, Cottie and his favourite uncle, George Pollexfen, walking at Rosses Point, on the north side of Sligo bay. The image is probably based on an imagined occasion. It is therefore a conglomeration of memories in which Yeats brings together two of the most influential people in his life. In the painting the figures are almost subsumed into the surrounding sea and sky, their forms tenuously delineated in paint, in a manner analogous to the vagaries of memory itself. Cottie and George are placed with Yeats in a favourite and cherished location. George Pollexfen had a summer house at Rosses Point where Jack visited him as a young man. The death of George in 1910 severed the familial connection with Sligo and was, like the death of Cottie nearly forty years later, an important psychological event in the artist’s life. At the end of his own life Yeats gave the painting to Sligo and wrote in his accompanying letter to the Mayor of Sligo that ‘From the beginning of my painting life every painting which I have made has somewhere in it a thought of Sligo’.

Market Day,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=market-day-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1906Dimensions: 35.5 × 25.25cmMedium: WatercolourProvenance: Purchased by public subscription from the Capuchin Annual, 1962
Fair days and market days fascinated Jack Yeats whose sketchbooks record the strange sights and characters to be seen at such events. This early watercolour features a stall in a country Irish town. In the background the quiet sunlit street is temporarily transformed by galloping horses ridden by farmers determined to get their business done and return to their work. The foreground is dominated by the covered stall, tended by a young woman in a large brimmed hat who patiently observes the goods. The latter is a remarkably eclectic collection of items which indicates both the comparative simplicity of the times and some of the main concerns of the population. Religious magazines, the linnet songbook and the book of fate make up the reading matter, while apples and jars of sweets provide edible treats. Among the other items a pipe and packets of tobacco are identifiable.
This very ordinary subject is transformed by the unusual viewpoint taken by Yeats which is really that of a potential customer standing beneath the strong blue canopy. The intense sunshine beams down on this structure and sends a strong blue tinge over the brim of the stall holder’s hat, casting her features in a strange blue shadow. The pole supporting the canopy divides the composition dramatically into two uneven parts.

Description
One of several images of shops that he created, Maunder’s Fish Shop, Chelsea dates to Whistler’s second period of lithography which was partly inspired by the resurgence of interest in the medium among French artists including Toulouse-Lautrec and Bonnard. Mrs Elizabeth Maunder’s fish-shop had been long established on Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where Whistler lived for a period (1). Chelsea is now one of the most expensive addresses in London but during the 1890s it was a largely working class neighborhood. The presence of Whistler and other artistic figures, including the Irish art dealer and collector Hugh Lane, contributed to the gentrification of the area.

Description:
This tiny painting belonged to Ria Mooney, an actress and the first woman producer at the Abbey Theatre. She worked on two of Jack Yeats’s plays there in the 1940s. Mooney presented this work and another Yeats painting, He Wins, to Sligo.
Mooney may have been drawn to this work because of its use of theatrical conceit. It is an ambiguous view of a Ben Bulben seen through a cottage window, apparently based on a memory of a scene from the house of a great-aunt of Yeats, who lived above the Rosses in Co.Sligo. The lady was known as Aunt Mickey and her home had a commanding view of Ben Bulben. The cosy image of an Irish country garden with climbing foliage and luscious window boxes contrasts with the austere form of the mountain viewed in the distance. The result is a sensuous and complex image of the famous Sligo mountain and the surrounding countryside.

Description:
Dublin gallery owner Victor Waddington showed Keating’s work from 1925 until 1957. In 1928 possibly because Keating’s work was selling well, Waddington commissioned from the artist two paintings featuring west of Ireland types. The first of these was ‘Old Kitty’ and the other was ‘The Turf Buyer’ (1928).
Keating was evidently pleased with Old Kitty and he returned to the theme again. He made a pastel study of old Kitty in 1930 in which he removed ll other visual elements and concentrated on her features.

Port Rachrainn,Maurice MacGonigal PRHA (1900 – 1979),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=port-rachrainn-by-maurice-macgonigal-prha-1900-1979,"Date: N.D.Dimensions: 76.5 × 51cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: On loan from the Haverty Trust
Description:
Maurice MacGonigal’s oeuvre included set designs for the Abbey Theatre, illustrations for Cuala Press and a mural for the Irish Pavilion at the New York World Fair. Despite this diversity, the work for which he is best remembered are his images of the landscape and people of the west of Ireland, particularly Connemara, Donegal and the islands of Achill and Aran. Less well known are his land and seascapes inspired by North County Dublin where he painted around Loughshinny, Rush, Skerries and Portrane.
The setting for this painting is the seashore at Portrane, which was traditionally known as Port Rachrainn. The unusual composition focuses on the abstracted patterns made by the lichen covered rocks in the foreground rather than Portrane Martello Tower which can be seen in the distance. Built during the nineteenth-century, at sites throughout the British Empire, Martello towers are small forts originally designed to defend the coasts of England and Ireland from invasion by Napoleonic forces. Around fifty Martello towers were built in Ireland, including a number on Dublin Bay all in sight of one another for communication purposes. The few surviving towers include this one at Portrane and the tower at Sandycove in which James Joyce once lived.

Healy in 1965, as a memorial to his parents John and Catherine Healy.
Description:
The original title of the painting has not been identified. It is probably the ‘Head and Shoulders of a Man with Landscape’ listed in the inventory of John Quinn’s collection in 1924. Hilary Pyle has compared the image of man silhouetted against a coastal landscape with one used by Yeats to illustrate A Broadsheet of February 1903. The latter was accompanied by Lady Gregory’s translation of ‘It’s my grief that I am of the race of poets’(1).
The Niland watercolour uses a blend of murky browns and strong greens in an expressive manner typical of Yeats’s early work in this medium. The painting is full of formal and thematic contrasts. The age and pensive nature of the man is contrasted by the youth and physical activity of the two swimmers in the sea behind him. The dramatic spatial gap between the figure in the foreground and the expanding coastline behind him further evokes the difference between his world of contemplative thought and the ongoing one of nature and physical life that surrounds him. It is a theme that Yeats was to develop in his later paintings for example, Many Ferries, (1948, National Gallery of Ireland) which uses a similar composition.

Description:
The subject of this intimate portrait is Solomons’ close friend Kathleen Goodfellow (1891–1980). Born in Dublin, Goodfellow was a poet and writer who published under the pseudonym Michael Scot. The two women, who were both members of Cumann na mBan, first met during the Easter Rising while sheltering from bullets on Mount Street.
In 1926, Solomons married the poet and editor James Starkey who was better known by his pen name, Seumas O’Sullivan. Together they produced the influential Dublin Magazine which played a significant role in encouraging Irish art and literature from the 1920s until O’Sullivan’s death in 1958. Goodfellow both contributed to, and was the primary patron of this publication. In 1938 Solomons and O’Sullivan became Goodfellow’s neighbours when they rented one of her houses on Morehampton Road, Donnybrook. The house, along with many others on the street, was owned by Goodfellow whose private income came from family property (1).
During their long friendship, Solomons’ painted her friend several times. Two of these portraits, both bequeath by Goodfellow, are in the Model and Niland Collection, another is in the National Gallery of Ireland.

Description:
Nick Miller was born in London in 1962 and studied Development Studies at the University of East Anglia before deciding to pursue his interest in art. Relocating to Ireland, he spent almost a decade in Dublin before moving to Kilmactranny, County Sligo, where he lived until his recent move to Rosses Point.
While much of Miller’s recent work has focused on the unruly hedgerows and rugged fields of Kilmactranny, he is also an accomplished portrait, figure and still life painter. In his encounters with each genre, Miller applies the same focused attention to capturing the atmosphere or mood of his subject. Inevitably, it is when the artist knows his subject well – be that a field or a figure – that this concentrated approach is most successful. Such paintings suggest the passage of time spent, not only in the physical laying on of paint, but also in developing a rapport between artist and subject.
The artist Barrie Cooke, who lives near Kilmactranny, is a close friend and helped Miller to acquire the truck he uses as a mobile studio. When he agreed to sit for this portrait, Cooke asked for a mirror to be set up so that he could watch the painting process.

Description
Jennie Mitchell was the younger sister of Susan Mitchell, the poet and writer whose portrait John B. Yeats later painted. Jennie got to know the Yeats family several years before her sister when she traveled with Lily Yeats on a boat from Ireland to England in 1890. She spent the next two years in Germany and Austria and on her way back to Ireland she visited the Yeats family in London. This drawing of her was made at this time. She was twenty-four years old. Yeats, who sketched his many guests, presents Jennie as a confident young woman. Her face with an open and frank expression is turned towards the artist in a natural and relaxed pose. Jennie had been brought up in Sligo and this common interest may have helped her to become a good friend of the Yeats sisters. In later life she published a number of stories and was a companion to her sister Susan. This drawing was presented to Sligo by their sister, Victoria Franklin in 1959.

Healy in New York to Sligo County Library and Museum. In memory of his parents, John and Catherine Healy, 1966.
Description
John O’Leary was a favorite subject of John Butler Yeats. The National Gallery of Ireland owns three portraits in oil of him by Yeats and there are several drawings in existence, of which the Niland Collection is one of the most striking. O’Leary was arrested in 1865 for his involvement in Fenian propaganda. He was sentenced to 20 years. He spent nine years in penal servitude in England and the rest living in exile in Paris. Upon his return to Dublin in 1885, O’Leary was a member of the Contemporary Club whose meetings Yeats also attended and this was where he first sketched the impressive bearded figure of the Fenian. O’Leary’s gentlemanly behaviour and his knowledge of nationalism and cultural matters made a great impression on John and William Butler Yeats. WB regarded O’Leary as the ideal personification of Irish patriotism to which he later referred in his opening lines of September 1913, ‘Romantic Ireland’s dead and gone, Its with O’Leary in the grave’.
The Niland Collection drawing was made in the home of Mrs. Alice Stopford Green, an historian and a passionate Irish nationalist. It is inscribed ‘John O’Leary, when dining with Mrs. Richard Green’. Stopford Green, the Irish born widow of J.R. Green, entertained significant literary and political figures at her home in Kensington Square in London, where this drawing was made. O’Leary along with Arthur Griffith and Edward Carson were regular guests. She returned to live in Ireland in 1918 and was made a senator of the Irish Free State in 1922.

Description:
Kitsy Franklin was the youngest child of Victoria Franklin, the sister of Jennie and Susan Mitchell whose portraits are in the Niland Collection. The Mitchells and the Franklins had strong connections with Sligo. Victoria attended school there with Jack B. Yeats and she married Harry Franklin in the town in 1899.
Kitsy was a brilliant musician and a favourite niece of Susan Mitchell. She shared her aunt’s delicate health but is shown in the full bloom of youthful splendour in AE’s portrait. AE was a life-long friend and colleague of Susan’s. They worked together on the Irish Homestead and in the 1920s on the Irish Statesman. He would have known and heard of Kitsy throughout her childhood and early womanhood. Her youth and beauty are emphasized through the simple white dress that she wears and the natural, informal manner of her hairstyle, where the blue ribbon has come undone. The portrait also hints at the spontaneity and energy of the sitter and by extension her creativity and imagination.

Portrait of Mary Colum,George William Russell (AE) (1867-1935),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=portrait-of-mary-colum-by-george-william-russell-ae-1867-1935,"Date: 1924Dimensions: 53.5 × 43cmMedium Oil: on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Unknown
Description:
Mary Colum (1884-1957) was an academic and writer who spent most of her adult life in New York. She was born in Collooney, Co. Sligo and later taught at Padraig Pearse’s school in St. Enda’s in Dublin. In 1912 she married the writer Padraic Colum whose literary career AE had encouraged. The couple emigrated to the United States in 1914.
Colum recounts the creation of this portrait in her auto-biography (1). It was painted in Dublin in 1924 while she was back on a visit from America. AE was interested in painting her so that he could hear her views on modern poetry, a subject on which she wrote and lectured. But during the sittings Colum had difficulty getting a word in as AE held forth on the topic. Colum found the best way of intervening was to ‘whirl off some strange piece of poetry’ usually in French or German which AE didn’t understand. AE got his revenge by making Colum’s curly red hair look wild in the finished portrait, despite the fact that she had had a finger wave put in to keep it under control. Colum also felt that AE had made her mouth too large while AE retorted that nature had given her practically no mouth and that he’d had to invent one for her. One gets a sense of the amiable tension between the two writers in the taut features of Colum’s face. The latter is relieved by the attention given to her red hair and the embroidered blue throw which she is wearing.

In memory of Dr. Thomas Bodkin.
Description:
William Orpen was one of the most successful artists of his generation. Born in Dublin, he studied at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, where he later became an influential teacher, and at the Slade School, London. Although he made his name painting the British aristocracy, Orpen also produced a number of portraits of distinguished Irish men for a series that Hugh Lane had originally commissioned from John B. Yeats. Orpen’s portrait of the Michael Davitt (1846–1906), Leader of the Land League, is now in the Collection of the Dublin City Gallery: The Hugh Lane, and is amongst the most successful of the series.
This painting has none of the refinement of the Hugh Lane work and appears to be an oil sketch more closely related to Orpen’s drawing of Davitt in the National Gallery of Ireland. Orpen only had a few sittings with Davitt and it is possible that both these works were executed from memory rather than life. Unusually, the Model and Niland portrait depicts Davitt’s torso from the right side. He had lost his right arm in his youth and was therefore usually depicted from the left.

Susan Mary Yeats (1866-1949) or Lily as she was called was the elder daughter of John Butler Yeats and the closest of his four children. Lily trained as an artist at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin and later worked as a textile artist with May Morris in London. She co-founded the Dun Emer Industries (1902) and the Cuala Industries (1908) with her sister Lolly, supervising the embroidery and textile work. Lily travelled with her father to New York in 1907 and was forced to leave him behind when he decided not to return to Ireland. Father and daughter corresponded regularly for the rest of his life and Lily’s letters were a source of amusement and comfort to the artist.John B. Yeats drew Lily many times. During her mother’s prolonged illness and after her death in 1900, Lily was the main female figure in the Yeats household and was frequently used as a model by her father. The drawing is inscribed ‘Lily Yeats as a Child’ by Lily herself who later identified many of her father’s drawings (1). Lily sits patiently with her hands crossed and has a thoughtful, distant expression on her face. Yeats was greatly admired as a painter of children, perhaps, because as in this case, he understood and was able to represent them as individuals rather than the conventional stereotypes often found in Victorian art.(1) H.

Description
This drawing was made while Susan Mitchell (1866-1926) was living as a paying guest and companion to Lily Yeats at the Yeats family home in Bedford Park in London. The future poet and journalist who would later work with AE on the Irish Homestead and the Irish Statesman made a very favourable impression on John Butler Yeats. He enjoyed her singing and her intellectual company. Susan also benefited from the experience of living in the Yeats household which was full of cultural conversation and interesting visitors. She later stated in a talk on John Butler Yeats that
‘In the home of Mr. Yeats I found myself in what seemed a wonderfulsociety, a society where ideas were raised above all other possessionsand where conversation ran on subjects, some of which I had indeedthought of, but which thinking I regretted in myself …’ (1).
The drawing is a preparatory study for an oil portrait which was completed in 1904 and which is now in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. Susan wears a white blouse with an elaborate lace collar fastened with a brooch. Yeats has depicted her costume in loose cross hatchings while the sitter’s head and features are more closely delineated. The drawing conveys the immediacy of Susan Mitchell’s presence and it shares the same intimate quality found in other sketches of the artist’s daughters and close female acquaintances with who John Butler Yeats was normally at ease.

Description:
This monochrome watercolour is an illustration to W.B. Yeats’s Stories of Red Hanrahan, which first appeared in The Secret Rose, (1897). This mystical text centres on the character of Red, a poet who sees the lovers of Ireland walking in procession on Ben Bulben. In this scene he stands and shouts to banish the ghost of one of these unhappy lovers, Devorgilla. The story and Yeats’s illustration of it are closely connected to the landscape and mythology of Sligo. Red Hanrahan stands on the dramatic rock of Lugnagall beneath which the Sligo countryside expands. Behind the gesturing figure the distinctive profile of Knocknarea with the tomb of Queen Meabh on its summit adds to the mystery and power of the landscape.
The painting was never published as an illustration and remained in Jack Yeats’s possession. His father, John Butler Yeats, provided the illustrations for W.B.’s book. The theme of Red Hanrahan recurs in Jack’s later work. It provided for him as with W.B. a fascinating symbol of the special relationship that exists between the artist and the mythical and historical significance of the land.

Sailor home from the sea,Jack B.

Healy as a memorial to his parents John and Catherine Healy.
Description:
This early oil painting is typical of the type of work Jack Yeats was producing around 1912. The oil is thickly applied but kept within the boundaries of the outline of the various elements, rather like a direct development of Yeats’s work as an illustrator. The composition is carefully worked out with the dark figure of the man outlined against the pale grey of the sky and the street behind him. Yeats’s use of colour is equally restrained. The predominant tones of black and grey are relieved by the blue of the sea and the bright red of the sailor’s hair and beard and his exotic looking crios style belt.
The man toasts his return from the sea. He wears a nautical style cap and stands on a roadway leading directly down to the shoreline. This setting is probably inspired by Rosses Point in Co. Sligo. The seafarer cuts a bizarre figure, conspicuous by his dark suit and red hair. Yeats hints at the adventurousness of the sailor’s life and at the way in which his presence on land introduces an exciting element into ordinary village life.

Description:
Born in Limerick, Seán Keating attended art classes in the Limerick Technical School before winning a scholarship to the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. At the Metropolitan School Keating was taught by William Orpen and soon became one of his favourite pupils. Orpen later appointed Keating as his assistant in London and also used him as a model in several of his Irish themed paintings including The Holy Well, 1916 and Man of the West, 1915. In both paintings Keating is depicted as the quintessential Irishman deeply rooted in the landscape and traditions of the west of Ireland.
Like Orpen, Keating created numerous self-portraits during his long career and often used himself and his friends as models. He also made a number of images where he depicted himself as a man of the west. This element of masquerade, which can be interpreted as Keating’s way of declaring his allegiance to a nationalist idea of Ireland, is particularly evident in his well known painting, Men of the West, 1915. Drawing on the iconography of both the Irish and American west, Keating depicts himself as a rebel, ready to defend the Irish flag and the traditional culture of the west of Ireland.

Description
This small oil painting is a preparatory work for John Butler Yeats’s Self-Portrait which he worked on for the last eleven years of his life. It relates to the later and larger Self-Portrait in the Yeats family collection and another version in the National Gallery of Ireland collection, both of which were found in the artist’s studio at the time of his death in 1922. A pencil study for these final oil versions of the Self-Portrait is also in the Niland Collection.
John Butler Yeats travelled with his daughter Lily to New York in 1907 ostensibly for a short visit. After several months Lily returned to Ireland without her father who remained in New York for the rest of his life. Without any regular income the elderly Yeats led a precarious existence and relied on the support and friendship of his admirers in America. John Quinn, the Irish-American lawyer and collector, was undoubtedly the most significant of these. In 1911 he commissioned a Self-Portrait from John B. Yeats and the artist threw himself into the project producing several drawings and oils over the following years.
While the final versions show the artist at his easel in his room at the Petitpas boarding house, this head and shoulders portrait is quite different. Its dramatic composition consists of four quadrants with the head of the artist a fifth and central element. The strong yellow and greens of the upper left section are echoed in the light filled features of the artist who looks directly out of the painting. The gold pin of his necktie breaks up the intense black of the lower half of the composition. The almost abstract qualities of the design reflect Yeats’s exposure to modernist art in New York where he visited the Armory Show in 1913.

Description:
This scene of children wading on a beach at sunset is an impressive example of Russell’s imaginative landscapes which were extremely popular when exhibited at the beginning of the 20th century. Many of his paintings were created while on holidays in Donegal or Sligo or at weekends when he had some free time from his other work as a poet, essayist and active member of the co-operative movement.
The influence of French Symbolist art which Russell would have known from collections in Ireland and England and through reproduction can be seen in the sinuous forms of the sand and the current of the tide which sweeps across the composition. The rich gold, blues and reds of the sky transform the scene from the mundane into something more timeless and significant. This exaggeration of the scene reflects Russell’s interest in spiritualism and belief in a higher reality. He has signed the painting AE in the lower right, which is derived from the word Aeon, meaning an emanation of God. Russell was an active member of Dublin’s Theosophical Society and claimed to have experienced supernatural visions.
This painting was bought from the artist by John Quinn. It is listed in a letter from Russell to Quinn of 17 October 1908 in which the artist confirms that it has been packed along with other paintings to send to New York (1). It was exhibited at the American Art Galleries in 1927 as part of the John Quinn collection where Healy may have acquired it. Healy presented the work to Sligo in 1966

Description:
A man stands on a summer’s evening holding a ballad sheet in his hands. His open mouth and expressive face indicate that he is singing. Behind him modest white-washed houses and a thatched building with a cart-wheel propped up against its wall suggest the modest rural setting where the performance is taking place. The ballad singer was a recurring theme in Yeats’s work, appearing in his Broadsheets and Broadsides as a central figure in Irish life. Ballad singers were nomadic people who travelled from fair to fair selling cheaply printed copies of ballads as souvenirs of their performances. Yeats collected many of these and used them as titles or as subjects for his work. Ballads were an important feature of popular entertainment and of the dispersal of music and culture in 19th century Ireland. The singer who could capture the attention and imagination of the community through his rendition of popular ballads was for Yeats an artist of considerable influence and significance.
The painting was given to James A. Healy by the artist in 1939 and subsequently presented to Sligo.

Healy as a memorial to his parents John and Catherine Healy
Description:
The five separate watercolours were based on sketches of men working on the Sligo quays at the turn of the 20th century. They were exhibited in Dublin in 1900 and purchased by John Quinn in 1902. Painted on the back of invitation cards to Jack Yeats’s 1899 Sketches in the West of Ireland exhibition, the five paintings were framed together by the artist to form one complete work. They show different workers involved in the shipping business in Sligo with which Yeats was very familiar. His grandfather William Pollexfen was the owner of a large merchant shipping concern in the town and Yeats spent much of his childhood in the company of his grandfather’s employees.
The paintings depict the bay pilot, who surveys the view with binoculars in hand, and the river pilot with peaked cap whose job was to guide the ships up the inlet of the sea at Rosses Point into Sligo town. The three other figures, the stevedore, the ganger and the gand are involved in the loading and unloading of the ships’ cargo. All these figures recur in Yeats’s later work but the most significant is the river pilot whose distinctive beard, cap and white shirt reappear in many later paintings.

Healy as a memorial to his parents John and Catherine Healy.
Description:
When shown in New York in 1904, the occasion of the artist’s only visit to the United States, the New York Times described the painting as ‘An Irish farmer on horseback resting with his feet out of stirrups as he reaches for his pipe during the wait in a fox hunt’. Certainly the figure seems to be taking a rest and surveying the scene around him although there is no suggestion of other figures or the excitement and noise of a hunt.
The low viewpoint looking up at the large figure of the man and his mount, adds to the dignity and authority of the farmer. Beneath him extends an expanse of open countryside leading to the sea with mountains dominating the horizon. The boggy, rocky ground on which the horse stands, is richly coloured in blues, greens, browns and purples. The enormous attention given to the sky which takes up four fifths of the composition lends an exotic note to the painting, suggesting the strangeness of the locality in which the farmer lives, right at the edge of the land.

The Funeral of Harry Boland,Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=the-funeral-of-harry-boland-by-jack-b-yeats-1871-1957,"Date: 1922Dimensions: 91.5 × 61cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: The Niland CollectionProvenance: Purchased by public subscription from the Capuchin Annual in 1962
Description:
This view of the funeral of republican, Harry Boland (1884-1922) was, according to Jack B. Yeats, the only visual record of the event. Cameras were confiscated at the gates of the cemetery. Boland, a former close friend of Michael Collins, died while trying to avoid arrest in Dublin in 1922. He had openly opposed the treaty and his death was a pivotal moment in the Irish Civil War.
Yeats shows the burial scene at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin with the O’Connell Monument dominating the background. While the earth from the freshly dug grave is evident in its bluish colour, Yeats’s focus is the crowd of onlookers rather than the coffin or body of Boland. Prominent male republicans including a group holding rifles, stand close to the flower strewn plot. Female figures in black mourning stand behind them. Beside them flanking the grave are members of Cuman na mBan, carrying wreaths of flowers. The tension of these regimented groups of figures is relieved by the two onlookers in the left hand foreground who appear to chat and comment on the scene in an informal manner. The work was exhibited at the RHA in 1923 under the title ‘A Funeral’ but was not mentioned in reviews. Later in 1942 Thomas MacGreevy drew public attention to the painting in an illustrated article in the widely read Capuchin Annual. He argued that ‘Yeats had risen to the full height of the heroic in art’ and that the work ‘had lifted the contemporary scene on to the plane of historical painting’ (1).(1) T.

Description:
Like his friend Seán Keating, Maurice MacGonigal was an academically trained artist who had strong links to the Royal Hibernian Academy and was not afraid to express his distaste for new ideas which he felt undermined tradition.
In 1969, the year that this painting was acquired by the Model and Niland, MacGonigal resigned from his position as the Professor of Painting at the National College of Art.His decision was the result of the students’ revolt against the conservatism of the curriculum which he believed eroded ‘the professional authority of the college’. In the same year, he strongly criticised the Irish Government on the tax-free concessions that it was offering to artists, arguing that such plans would fill Ireland with the ‘art parasites of Europe’.
Despite his reactionary views on the art world, MacGonigal’s late work displays the effects of artistic experimentation. In paintings such as The Gathering, the expressive brush strokes create a sense of animation and rhythm that is at odds with his earlier realist style. While still drawing inspiration from the landscape and people of the west, during the last decade of his life, MacGonigal used a new expressive aesthetic to reinvigorate his familiar subject matter.

Healy Collection, donated by James A. Healy to Sligo Corporation in 1975
Description:
This early watercolour shows a view of the hill of Mountpellier, seen from Tibradden in south county Dublin.
Visible on the summit are the large ruins of the Hell Fire Club, an 18th century sporting lodge, which subsequently developed a notorious reputation for gambling and carousing.
Painted just after the Second World War, when le Brocquy was about to embark on a career in London, the painting reveals his knowledge of contemporary British art. The dark tones most evident in the foreground and the subject matter are influenced by the neo-romanticist movement. A number of artists associated with this style, most notably John Piper, exhibited in Dublin during the war.
The isolation of these years when continental Europe was inaccessible encouraged more modernist artists like le Brocquy to find their subjects within Ireland. Here the artist presents the landscape in terms of simple geometric forms which ultimately derive from cubism.
The low viewpoint accentuates the large scale of the mountain and the dark ambiguous forms of the trees transform the landscape into something strange and unfamiliar.

The Metal Man stands on a plinth at the mouth of the harbour at Rosses Point, Co. Sligo. It was erected in Napoleonic times as is evident from its distinctive costume. Its purpose was to guide ships into the safe channel. The extended arm of the Metal Man shows the way. This very early watercolour gives a close-up view of the monument as though sketched from the sea immediately beneath. The Metal Man recurs in several subsequent paintings and drawings by Yeats, most notably as an illustration in his book, Life in the West of Ireland, (1912). The much-loved figure symbolised both childhood memories of Sligo and the adventure of the sea-faring life.

The Road,Seán McSweeney (1935 - 2018),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=the-road-by-sean-mcsweeney-1935-2018,"Date: 1965Dimensions: 120 × 100cmMedium: Oil on canvasCollection: Niland CollectionProvenance: Purchased in 1969
Description:
Sean McSweeney moved to Sligo in the 1980s when his work has become synonymous with the county. His mother came from Ballyconnell in Co.Sligo and McSweeney spent his childhood holidays there. His present studio is in the former schoolhouse where his mother attended classes. Thus the locality in which the artist lives and works and which he paints has very strong personal associations.
The Road is a relatively early work which predates the artist’s move to the West. It was painted while he was living in Wicklow, close to Dublin where McSweeney grew up and became an artist. Largely self-taught like many of the leading Irish painters of his generation, McSweeney learnt about art from looking at the paintings of Paul Henry and Jack Yeats in public collections. His work also shows his awareness of international post-war painting. It reflects his willingness to experiment with colour and form and to develop a strong personal style which is inspired by landscape. Roadways and bogholes – evidence of man’s interference and man’s presence in the land form the focus of many of McSweeney’s paintings. In this work a roadway leads up a steep mountain side where it appears like a cascade of colour incapable of penetrating the summit. The act of painting the landscape has transformed it into a luminous almost abstract image. The use of different brushstrokes and techniques of applying the paint are evident, creating a richly textured surface. Colours have been multilayered revealing sudden contrasts of tone. McSweeney’s relationship to the landscape is ultimately a romantic one in which he struggles and succeeds in capturing its essence through paint.

Description:
The artist depicts himself standing at Rosses Point, Co. Sligo, looking out towards the sea. The darkened sky is lit up by a beacon of yellow and white light emanating from an unseen lighthouse to the right of the composition. Most of the painting is taken up by the deep blue of the night sky dominated by a dark cloud. This is contrasted by the grey-white surface of the road and the crashing waves, and by the bright colour of the surrounding vegetation. The man stands, hat in hand, in awe of the power of the natural world. The work, which was painted while Yeats’s wife of more than fifty years was dying, has been read as a metaphor for the artist’s grief. Like many of his later paintings he sets himself or the human figure against the magnitude of creation.

Description:
Yeats transforms an image of a jockey on horseback into a poignant and poetic idea in this early watercolour. The cut-off composition emphasises the strength of the horse whose powerful head and neck is raised up as he moves along. The jockey, who keeps a firm grip on the reins, is presented as a shadowy but skilful figure. The left-hand side of the composition is devoted to an open view of the landscape. Knocknarea can be seen in the distance beyond the purple of the roadway and the evening lights of the cottages.
The title, Stargazer, refers to the way in which the horse and man are concerned with the evening sky rather than the road ahead. Their connection to their surroundings is therefore far from mundane. Yeats introduces a mystical element in which the rider’s interest in the celestial sphere transcends ordinary experience. The painting was shown in one of Yeats’s earliest Sketches from Life in the West of Ireland exhibitions in Dublin in 1900. Its composition was misread by at least one reviewer who felt the country racer carried the head abnormally high (1). But the painting’s ability to inject metaphysical ideas into depictions of rural Irish life was of enormous significance to Irish visual art of this period.

Description:
A young boy in an old fashioned costume is playing with a cut-out theatre. His youth is accentuated by his having to stand on a stool to comfortably reach up to the table. The theatre is like the ones that Jack Yeats designed and made in the early 1900s to entertain the local children in Devon where he was living at the time. A number of these plays were published and they feature similar stories of pirates and hidden treasure as seen in the one in this painting. Yeats had an abiding passion for the theatre especially for melodrama.
Behind the boy, through the window, can be seen a large house and beyond it a ship at anchor. This setting has been identified as Sligo where Jack Yeats would have spent many hours as a child playing in this solitary fashion with his mind full of the sea and nautical adventures. His grandfather, William Pollexfen, ran a shipping business in the town and Yeats seems in this painting to deliberately juxtapose the imagination of the child with the reality of the adult world beyond the playroom window.
The Toy Theatre painting has previously inspired one of our primary school collaboration programs (The Toy Theatre Primary Schools Programme). Young students from a variety of local primary schools were invited to take part, and with the help of some resources from “The Model” they were able to build their own small theatrical stages to perform and record a series of puppet shows that they wrote and directed themselves.

Description:
As Professor of Painting at the Metropolitan School of Art from 1937–1954, and President of the Royal Hibernian Academy from 1949–1962, Seán Keating exerted a strong hold over the Irish art establishment. His traditional views on painting and subject matter were partly fuelled by his conviction that Irish art should record both the culture and the traditions of the west, and the national struggle for independence.
In works such as Turf-Gatherer, Keating celebrated a way of life that was unique to the west of Ireland and depicted those who maintained it as noble figures deeply connected to the local landscape. Despite his respect for tradition, Keating was not opposed to progress. During the 1920s he was commissioned by the Electricity Supply Board to record the construction of the Ardnacrusha hydroelectric power station on the River Shannon and in the 1940s. He also documented a similar project on the Liffey. In the resulting paintings, engineers and work men are depicted with the same respect and sense of purpose as this weather-worn turf-gatherer.
A pastel preparatory drawing for this work was acquired by the Belfast artist, Theo Gracey in 1939, which may suggest that the finished work dates to this period.

Description:
This artwork is part of a group of paintings, dating to an early part of Prendergast’s career, which reveal her interest in two major themes – the body and the landscape. This delicate watercolour combines paint with gold-leaf and shows distorted female forms emerging from the land. The rich bronze colour evokes the boggy landscape of much of Ireland out of which preserved human remains have often been recovered. The rich symbolism of the land as a receptacle for the human body has been most famously commemorated in the poetry of Seamus Heaney. The gold leaf, reminiscent of ancient gold of the bronze and the Celtic iron age, when the bog was considered sacred, enriches the archaeological associations of Prendergast’s work. In her subsequent treatment of the theme she was to develop an analytical approach using mapping and cartography as metaphors for plotting the complex relationship between humanity and the landscape.
The painting was presented to Sligo by Vincent Ferguson, an important collector of contemporary Irish art. An early admirer of Prendergast’s work, he acquired this at her MA degree show at the National College of Art and Design in the mid 1980s.

Description:
A Suffragette and a fervent campaigner for women’s rights, Constance Gore-Booth or Countess Markievicz as she was later known, is best remembered for her role in the Easter Rising where she was a leading member of the Irish Citizen’s Army. Although she was condemned to death in 1916 her gender resulted in the sentence being commuted to penal servitude for life and, after spending periods in Aylesbury and Holloway jails, she was released. During her confinement, Gore-Booth’s sister, Eva, supplied her with art materials which allowed her to complete a number of drawings and watercolours including this work on a mythical theme. Representing three riders on horse back with Celtic knot work on their robes and bridles, this delicate work may have been inspired by myths about the ancient race of the Fianna.
Gore-Booth was later to become the first woman to be elected to the British Parliament, but complying with Sinn Féin’s policy, she refused to take her seat. She was also a member of the first Dáil Éireann, where she was appointed Minister for Labour, and later joined de Valera’s Fianna Fáil party.

Description:
Jack B. Yeats recognized the central role of the shop in Irish country life. His 1912 book Life in the West of Ireland featured an illustration entitled, The Country Shop, showing a rather formidable shopkeeper, Mrs. Jordan going over the accounts with a customer in the interior of a shop. This was based on a sketch made in Belmullet, Co. Mayo in 1905 when Yeats traveled through the West with J.M. Synge.
Interior of a Shop dates to the same period. It may have been intended to illustrate Synge’s articles on the Congested Districts Board which were published in the Manchester Guardian in 1905 (1). One of remedies promoted by the Board for the overcrowding and poverty of the West was emigration. A poster on the wall of the shop, behind the shopkeeper, advertises a shipping line to America. A sack in the lower right is emblazoned with an official American stamp and eagle. A large travelling trunk is propped up against this. The shopkeeper has his ledger on the counter in front of him, a crucial piece of equipment in which all his costumers’ accounts are carefully noted. The man is engrossed in reading a note, perhaps a letter from a relative who has gone to America.

Healy in New York to Sligo County Library and Museum. In memory of his parents, John and Catherine Healy, 1965.
Description:
Painted in the artist’s late expressionistic style in which Yeats was just beginning to work, the painting conveys his powers of observation and insight into human nature. Two young women sit beneath a thorn tree, while a horseman stops to greet them. Behind the figures to the right, a squalling shower painted in yellow and cream, obscures the blue summer sky.
The women’s reaction to the passerby is subtly delineated. The dark haired woman looks directly at the man while her companion, with downcast eyes, appears to be shy. The thorn tree is used as a dramatic device which connects the two very different halves of the composition. On the right the women are seated on a grassy bank with a lush landscape extending behind them that suggests a feminine domain. The left hand side with the man and horse on the stony roadway silhouetted against a blue sky is much more austere and masculine. At a more basic level the painting refers to the constantly changing weather of the West of Ireland and of the companionship of the open road where people stop to chat and greet each other.

Description:
Keating’s first visit to the Aran Islands in 1914 had a deep impact on his life and art.
He concluded that the essence of Irishness resided in the inhabitants of the west and in works such as William and Mary he elevated country folk to native nobility.
Although many of his representations of western figures appear to be types rather than individuals, he did use his friends and acquaintances as models and sometimes recycled faces in a number of different works. The model for William in this piece also appears in a pastel sketch known as Two Men with Wine Goblets and has been identified as a rather caricatured portrait of Michael P. Cronin of Dromscarra, Kiskeam, Co. Cork, who also sat for Keating’s Republican Court, 1921, painted in 1946.
This work was presented to the Model and Niland Collection by the Haverty Trust which was established to encourage Irish art by purchasing works and donating them to public institutions. The Trust made its first purchases in 1930 and, as they usually bought contemporary work, William and Mary is likely to date from after that date and may have been produced around 1946 when Keating was working on Republican Court, 1921.

Woman in Riding Habit,Estella Solomons (1882-1968),https://www.themodel.ie/?artwork=woman-in-riding-habit-by-estella-solomons-1882-1968,"Date: N.D.Dimensions: 51 × 91.5cmMedium: Oil on canvasProvenance: Bequest of Ms K Goodfellow, 1980
Born into a Dublin Jewish family, Estella Solomons studied under William Orpen at the Metropolitan School of Art, with Walter Osborne at the Royal Hibernian Schools and at the Chelsea School of Art. After periods in Paris and Amsterdam she returned to Dublin and set up a studio on Great Brunswick Street (now Pearse Street) that soon became a meeting place for artists, writers and politicians including her friends George Russell, Francis Beckett and Dorothy and Beatrice Elvery.
Solomons was a sensitive portraitist and an accomplished etcher and landscape painter who often took Dublin, Donegal and Kerry as her subjects. She produced images of many of her artistic circle including Russell, A.J. Levanthal, James Stephens and Jack B. Yeats as well as public figures such as Arthur Griffith and Horace Plunkett. A committed nationalist and member of Cumann na mBan, she is also believed to have produced portraits of fugitives of the Rising and Civil War whom she sheltered in her city centre studio.
The subject of this portrait is not known but the riding paraphernalia suggests the influence of Orpen’s much more elaborate portrait Gardenia St. George with Riding Crop."

Description
While some of his symbolist works relate to famous works of classical music, including Wagner’s opera Das Rheingold, others, such as Wood Nymph, depict female nudes in natural settings and appear to have few specific mythological references.
In Greek mythology nymphs were minor nature goddesses who appeared as beautiful maidens and usually inhabited the sea, rivers, woods or trees.
Throughout history artists have used mythological themes as an excuse to paint the female nude. Created using thin glazes of paint, this atmospheric image of reclining nude in a woodland setting fits into this genre.
